### Project Overview

In this project, our goal is to build a predictive model to estimate calories burnt based on various features such as age, weight, and more. By analyzing the provided datasets, we aim to develop an accurate model to predict the calories burnt during exercise.

### Data source 

Calories Data: Contains the user ID and the corresponding calories burnt.

Exercise Data: Contains features that will help us predict the calories burnt by the user, such as age, weight, duration of exercise, etc.
